version 1.5c

Jim Grishaw <jgrishaw@myrealbox.com>
- fixes for cygwin

- added tty test suite (test/ directory)

-----------------------------

version 1.5b

Richard Hoyle <rhoyle@cix.co.uk>
- fix problem with initial flush of tty on some systems (slackware 9.0)

- cleanup, got rid of c++ style comments, fixed warnings

-----------------------------

version 1.5a

- now compiles with readline v4.2
- works on MacOS X

config:
- detect readline headers
- fixed configure.in bug (-ltermcap not needed in AC_CHECK_LIB) (Jeff Squyres)

-----------------------------

v1.5
- now compiles under solaris

- added hostname in prompt
- fixed tilde expansion: used to done by glob()'s GLOB_TILDE option
  which is not supported everywhere, and is buggy 
 	( substitutes in ~/a/b but not in ~/a/b/c !)
  some more code now replaces this ...
- improved completion : builtin, tilde and pathname completions

- cleaned/rewrote openpty.c
  - ask user whether to continue after failed grantpt()
    or if using a tty with dangerous perms
  - check that old controlling tty has been dropped
  - under linux use /dev/ptmx if available instead of /dev/pty*
  - should be easier to port
- added 'suspend' and 'disconnect' builtins
- fixed race conditions due to fork()
- fixed signal handlers : they have to reset themselves so that it works
  everywhere ...
- fixed some memory leaks
- cleaning cleaning cleaning

- added '--force' option to avoid being asked questions (doesn't suppres 
  warnings though)
- added '--' option to allow separation of zssh options from ssh options

- handle quotes in --shell option, so that we can now do some really weird
  stuff such as:
	zssh -s "sh -c 'ps aux | grep ssh'"

config:
  - detect pty functions/devices available
  - added '--disable-readline' option of configure to allow building zssh
    without libreadline
  - use -Wall compiler option if available

-----------------------------

v1.4

- added escape key help msg
- fixed rpm spec file bug
- added escape builtin : allows to change the escape key 
- added -s switch to allow the remote shell to be changed
- fixed bug with child handling (delay in sfork)
- added hook builtin : allows to hook any proram to the tty/pty,
  not just rz and sz
- added ztelnet hard link : remote logging prg defaults to "telnet -8 -E"
  instead of "ssh -e none"

------------------------------

v1.3

- Fixed a bug that cause the app to segfault under FreeBSD
  (globbing.c:27)
- Added redefinable escape sequence (environment variable and command
  line arg)
- tilde expansion is now performed (provided the GLOB_TILDE flag is supported
  by the glob(3) function)

------------------------------

v1.2*

- Install problem fixes mainly

------------------------------

v1.1

- Changed escape sequence from Alt-1 to ^@ (C-space)
  Alt-1 is bound by default under window maker
  and Ctrl-x sequences will be easier to customize.

------------------------------

v1.0

- Removed sending of "rz" command to the remote shell,
  it seems it works just fine without !
- Fixed ^D in local shell... caused segfault
- ^C works when sz-ing (^X sent to interrupt remote rz)
  rz-ing not tested yet
- Added test for both text and X11 Alt-1 key codes
- fixed bug in shell escapes handling : used to exit on parse error !
- Added builtin 'repeat'
- Now correctly flushes output after ^C during transfert
  The tty should no longer be polluted !
