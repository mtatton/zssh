todo:
- update INSTALL (configure arguments)
- and add a generic INSTALL file


** CODE **
**********

todo:

- find a solution for *bsd users 
  -> should neither be insecure, nor require suid privileges (...)
- add support for irix
	(segfaults mysteriously for now ...)
- detect if telnet accepts '-8' and do something if this is not the case
- add ZSSH_FORCE env variable


done:

- check for readline headers in configure script
- works on MacOS X:
  - updated config: readline depends on (n)curses instead of termcap on some systems
  - don't use getpgid(): some systems don't have it
- now compiles with readline v4.2
