Dependencies :

libreadline, libtermcap and their headers must be properly installed

(if you're using rpm, make sure the packages 
   readline, readline-devel, libtermcap, libtermcap-devel
 are installed)

****************************************************************************

Just follow the usual steps :
     > ./configure
     (edit Makefile)
     > make
     > su
     # make install

****************************************************************************

Testing tools:

the test/ directory has a few tools to trace tty problems.

****************************************************************************

NetBSD
------

you may have to tell configure where to find libreadline,
which is usually in /usr/pkg/lib :

CFLAGS=-I/usr/pkg/include  LIBS=-L/usr/pkg/lib  ./configure

****************************************************************************

If compilation fails, edit the Makefile produced by the configure script
to ensure it is correct for your system.


If you want to install the rz/sz commands from the lrzsz package
(probably because you don't have them, or they don't work), you'll
also have to :
     > make lrzsz
     > su
     # make lrzsz_install
     # make lrzsz_links		(make symlinks : sz -> lsz, rz -> lrz ...)

** Also, make _sure_ the new programs are run and not the old ones
** -> Check your path / (re)move the old ones / do as you wish
** `whereis sz' should answer /usr/local/bin/sz (or where-ever you put it)

Also remember that sz and rz need to be installed on the remote host and
(preferably) be somewhat compatible with your local versions for the magic
to work. Hopefully, rz and sz will already be there and working =)


arch: tested on
	- linux
	- NetBSD
	- OpenBSD
	- FreeBSD

      you're on your own anywhere else ... (though POSIX should be ok)

other make rules :
      clean : cleans temporary and binary files

      distclean : even removes autoconf files
		  config.h, Makefile

      uninstall : remove installed files
