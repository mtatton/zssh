This directory has a few utilities that will hopefully make it easier to trace
tty problems. Here's how to proceed:

1) test tty sanity on the local host (the one you're running zssh on).
   - cd in this directory, type make to build the tools.
   - run ./local_test. this script runs local_tty_test, which basically opens
     a pty/tty pair on the local host, prints all 256 ascii chars on the tty,
     and displays what comes out of the pty on stdout.
     it also checks the other direction - writing to the pty, reading frome the
     tty.

2) test tty sanity on the remote host (the one you're ssh'ing to).
   same thing: copy the zssh source tree there, run configure, cd to the test/
   directory, type make and run the script.

3) end to end test:

  [local side]
   - on the local host, cd to this directory (test/).
   - connect to the remote side using zssh

  [remote side, through zssh]
   - cd to the test/ directory that got created in step 2)
   - there should be a ttydump program in there. it roughly does a 
	cat > output.dump
     (as the tty is put in raw mode however, it's immune to ^C and stuff, so
      you'll have to kill it from another term)
     run it:

         $ ./ttydump
         type ' kill  15627 ' to kill me  
         output file is output.dump       

   - now hit the zssh escape key, and type

         zssh > hook ./ttyprint
    
     that will send our reference output on the tty.   
   - now kill ttydump from another term on the remote host.
   - check the output:

         $ ./check_remote_test
         remote tty test passed !

4) end to end test, the other way this time:
   proceed likewise but with the remote side sending, and local side receiving:
   	
  [remote side, through zssh]
   - it's a little bit more tricky because you need to setup the local side before
     the remote side can send, so :

         $ sleep 20 ; ./ttyprint

   - hit zssh escape key

         zssh > hook ./ttydump

  [local side]
   - wait 20 seconds, kill ttydump
   - check the output:

         $ ./check_remote_test
         remote tty test passed !
