		------------------------


1) It doesn't even compile ! What should i do ?

    Chances are your OS has  not been tested yet.  First delete config.h.in
    and  remake it  using autoheader  (you need  autoconf  installed).  The
    configure script can be regenerated using autoconf ...


2) It doesn't seem to work ! pressing ^@ (C-space) is ineffective.

    You are maybe using a console/terminal emulator that does not allow
    you to generate this code (Gnome Terminal is affected), or your window
    manager is using this key, so underlying applications won't ever see
    it ...
    Try using another terminal emulator/escape sequence.
    To change the escape sequence, either define the ZSSHESCAPE variable
    or use the -z option for zssh.


3) It just doesn't transmit any file, though i invoke the sz/rz commands as
   explained in the man page.

    zssh depends on 3 other binaries  to operate properly : ssh, sz and rz.
    ssh is run  from the local machine,  sz and rz are run  from _both_ the
    local and remote machine.
    
    Actually, when downloading remote runs sz, local  runs rz 
	           uploading   local  runs sz, remote runs rz. 
    
    zssh thus depends on the rz/sz  package to be working on both machines,
    _and_ of compatible versions.  Make sure the problem does not come from
    sz/rz before suspecting zssh.


4) I don't get my shell prompt back after file transfer completes !!!

    Just press return 2 or 3 times and stay calm =)

5) File transfer is initiated but never completes

( ie a line like :
    Bytes Sent:  38144/4610624   BPS:3424     ETA 22:15
  or
    Bytes Sent:      0/    513   BPS:0        ETA 00:00  Retry 0: Got ZCAN
  can be seen, but transfer never completes
)

Chances are the pty/tty on one of the systems are not 8-bit clean.
(Linux is 8-bit clean, NetBSD is not)
Using the -e (escape) option of sz should solve this problem.

6) It still doesn't work

Beware that any program interferring (ie non transparent) with the tty/pty
chain will likely prevent file tranfers from working.

For example, running 'screen' on the REMOTE side will prevent zssh from
working properly because it will be messing things between sz and rz :

(screen on the local side is no problem of course)
