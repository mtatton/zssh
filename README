			--------------------


zssh  (Zmodem SSH)  a program  for  interactively transferring  files to  a
remote machine while using the secure shell  ( ssh ).  It is intended to be
a convenient alternative to scp , allowing to transfer files without having
to open another session and re-authenticate oneself.

Files  are transferred through  the zmodem  protocol, using  the rz  and sz
commands.   If you  don't  already have  them,  the sz/rz  programs can  be
installed from Uwe Ohse's lrzsz package included in this directory.
